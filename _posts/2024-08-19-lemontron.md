I have a zest for 3d printing, which is why I've created a new 3d Printer called the Lemontron.

I’ve been passionately working on this project with a single goal in mind: to create a 3D printer that is as versatile as it is portable. Lemontron is designed to fit neatly into a standard filament box, making it the perfect tool for anyone who values efficiency without compromising on quality.

Whether you’re a seasoned 3D printing enthusiast or just getting started, Lemontron offers something new. It’s easy to assemble, disassemble, and store, without sacrificing the performance you expect from a full-sized 3D printer. With Lemontron, you can take your zest for printing anywhere.
