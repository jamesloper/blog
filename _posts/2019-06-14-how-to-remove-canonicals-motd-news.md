Ubuntu always greets you with a wordy "message of the day" blurb and a small ad for Livepatch. All these blurbs are generated by shell scripts, and you can customize them by entering the motd directory.

If you want to simply hush all messages, all you do is `touch ~/.hushlogin` and that's it! Otherwise, you could edit each script.

``` bash
cd /etc/update-motd.d
rm 51-cloudguest
rm 10-help-text
```

However, it's not always best to remove the file. Instead, you should make it exit early. You can disable the Canonical Livepatch ad safely without deleting the file:

1. edit `/etc/default/motd-news` and change `ENABLED=1` to `ENABLED=0`
2. edit `/etc/update-motd.d/80-livepatch` and add `exit 0` after the `#!/bin/sh`.

Your greeting screen should now be short and simple and look like this:
