An always-online server running a full Ubuntu Desktop can be useful for many reasons. I usually use DigitalOcean but the <a href="http://ovh.com/" target="_blank">France-based host OVH</a> seems perfect for this scenario &mdash; They're probably not amazing enough for mission-critical operations but the price is too low to pass up.<br>
<br>

<h4>Initial Setup</h4>
You should now be running a server with Ubuntu Server 14.04. Once you're remotely logged in, you can execute these commands to prep the server.
<ul>
	<li><kbd>apt-get update && apt-get upgrade</kbd></li>
	<li><kbd>apt-get install nano</kbd>
	<li><kbd>reboot</kbd>
</ul>

<h4>Install Desktop</h4>
The familiar desktops Unity and Gnome don't work without a display plugged in so the next best choice is Xfce which is like the Raspberry Pi desktop.
<ul>
	<li><kbd>apt-get install xfce4 xfce4-goodies tightvncserver</kbd></li>
</ul>

<h4>Configure Accounts</h4>
For each user you want to add, run <kbd>adduser <b>username</b></kbd>. Each will have it's own desktop environment. If you'd like the user to be a full admin run <kbd>usermod -a -G sudo <b>username</b></kbd>.


<h4>Configure VNC</h4>
Repeat this process until all users are configured. Each user will have its own configuration. 
<ul>
	<li>Run <kbd>su <b>username</b></kbd> to change to the test user.
	<li>Run <kbd>vncserver -geometry <b>1440x900</b></kbd> and choose a password.</li>
	<li>Run <kbd>nano ~/.vnc/xstartup</kbd> and replace with this:
<pre>
xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
startxfce4 &
</pre>
	</li>
	<li><kbd>chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup</kbd>
</ul>

<h4>Connect</h4>
Use your favorite VNC app to connect.
