You probably think the hallmark of a successful business is the ability to ruthlessly prioritize the things that move the needle.
You also claim you iterate small changes to you product to gradually make it better. But there is an inherent flaw in that iterations are small, so you are way more likely to prioritize the "big new feaure" over making any revisions to old features.
Have you ever even iterated? How about gone back and actually removed a feature you thought was a certain heavy hitter that ended up being just a nice-to-have?
I think the hallmark of a successful business is the ability to follow up and iterate, and that means reconsidering that new shiny feature you are eager to implement. It might turn out to be a nice-to-have anyway.
