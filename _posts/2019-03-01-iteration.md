You probably think the hallmark bad ass business is the ability to ruthlessly prioritize things that move the needle.
You're also infatuated with the idea of iterating your existing features to acheive the ideal UX. 

But there is an inherent flaw. You always prioritize the big new feaure over small iterations. The old features are already there and they kind of work. According to what dozens of investors told you, you need to move the needle as far as you can, and that guides your attention to a big new feature.

Have you even truly iterated? How about removed a feature you thought was a certain winner that ended up being just a nice-to-have?

I think the hallmark of a successful business is the ability to follow up, and that means reconsidering that new shiny feature you are eager to implement. It might turn out to be only a nice-to-have anyway.
