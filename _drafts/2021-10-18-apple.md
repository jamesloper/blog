Steve Jobs propelled his company to smartphone dominance and since then, others have yet to even attempt an innovation as bold. Arguably, nobody has made anything as impactful as the omnipotent glass rectangle which obliterated the need for literally anything that it could replace. So why, then, has my attitude towards apple rotted to the core?

Creating a massive leap forward in technology widens the gap between it and the next best thing. This gap can be squeezed, and squoze it did. But not for innovation but rather for profit. Apple had the 1st mover advantage and they used it.

Fast forward to modern times. The app store literally defines distribution of digital content. Not only is it far and beyond the most visited app storefront, it also writes the rules- the rules of the walled garden.
